Filling issues and feature requests
-----------------------------------

Go into our github account https://github.com/jelix/docs-jelix-org to fill 
issues or to do pull request.


Installing a development environment
------------------------------------

The prefered way is to use the Vagrant configuration you have in the dev/ folder.
Vagrant is a tool which allow to create easily a Virtual Machine.

Install Vagrant, go into the dev/ folder and type ```vagrant up```. A linux server
is then configured in a virtual machine and docs.jelix.org is installed. The first time
you do ```vagrant up```, it may take few minutes.

You can then go on http://localhost:8050.
